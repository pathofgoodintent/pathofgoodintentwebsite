Welcome to a monthly series of blog posts that aims to capture the current state of development for the Path of Good Intent!

These updates serve to keep track of how the game changes throughout its development and will be split into the following categories:

1. [Game development](#game-development-updates)
2. [Game marketing](#game-marketing-updates)
3. [General thoughts](#general-thoughts)

## Game development updates ##

This month was focused on actually creating the final product that will be sold. That includes things like the rulebook, the box, and the board.

### Game mechanics

### Game theme

#### Custom illustrations for the Office Politics cards

Last month, I talked about using free illustrations off the internet and whether or not that would be a commercially viable method. What I ended up doing was hiring an illustrator off of fiverr to mimic the existing free art to create original illustrations.

## General thoughts ##

In terms of the game mechanics, I am pretty content with the current build. Just a few more number tweaks and balance changes and I think it'll be ready for production.

Fingers crossed for a commercially viable product within the next coming weeks!

Thank you for reading the March update for the Path of Good Intent. Tune in next month for more updates!
