#### Custom illustrations for the Office Politics cards

On [February](/2019/02/28/february-update.html), I talked about using free illustrations off the Internet and whether or not that would be a commercially viable method. What I ended up doing was hiring an illustrator off of fiverr to mimic the existing free art to create original illustrations.

## General thoughts ##

In terms of the game mechanics, I am pretty content with the current build. Just a few more number tweaks and balance changes and I think it'll be ready for production.

Fingers crossed for a commercially viable product within the next coming weeks!

Thank you for reading the March update for the Sysifus Corp. Tune in next month for more updates!
