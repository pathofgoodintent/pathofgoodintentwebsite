Thoughts as I designed my first ever prototype
Some questions I get asked frequently when I tell people that I made a board game:

What made you decide to get into board games?
How did you come up with the theme for the game?
How did you come up with the abilities and game-play mechanics?

There were several game mechanics that I had always wanted to incorporate into my game.

Unique abilities
Abilities that are not tied to a single player
Changing what abilities you can use during a game

I thought that a lot of games focused on character or ability selection. And that felt a bit too rigid for my tastes. Nothing wrong with creating characters or classes, I just wanted to know if it was possible to make a game where everyone was a true blank slate.

From this, I dabbled with several gameplay mechanics such as drafting abilities, a career based leveling progression system, and multiple sources of currency.

Here, I made the fatal mistake of assuming that a large variety of abilities make a game fun. So I focused on creating a lot of abilities. I had no idea what the end goal was for my game, all I knew was that making abilities meant complexity and I was so sure in my head that complexity meant fun.
