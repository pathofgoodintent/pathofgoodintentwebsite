Hi there. My name is [Wonmin][wonmin-website] (pronounced like 1 minute) and I am a 27 year old Korean American living in NYC. I wanted to use this post to explain how/why I decided to make a board game (for the dozens of people out there who are curious).

I used to work for a large tech company after graduating college. I quit shortly after my third year work-iversary because I realized that , if three years can zip by so fast, there's nothing stopping the next 20 years of my life disappearing as well into the giant machine that is corporate America.

From there, I started a [internet-based service][domahub-website] that helps domain owners sell their domains. While it was fun to build a product from the ground up and dictate my own working hours, I knew that deep down it wasn't what got my engine running.

When people ask me, "what made you decide to make a board game?" My answer usually follows the below script:

1. I'm a huge gamer, and I've always wanted to make my own game.
2. I've been coding for the past two years and I'm a bit burnt out of it.
3. And the only way to make a game without coding is, well, to make a board game!
