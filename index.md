_Path of Good Intent_ is a board game that mirrors the modern rat-race that we call life (AKA _#adulting_).

* Choose your own path in life by laying down cards.
* Earn <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:blue;">ka</span>r<span style="color:red;">ma</span></span> by moving (living) around on the board (life).
* Activate special cards to advance yourself or screw over others.

Can you be the first to make it in life?
