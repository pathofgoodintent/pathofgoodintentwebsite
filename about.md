Welcome to the development blog for _Sysifus Corp_!

This blog serves to document the process of creating a board game from scratch. A place to record all of the ups & downs, innermost secrets or fears, and the blood / sweat / tears that go into creating a tangible product.

I'd like to thank you for visiting and welcome you along on our journey. While I'm not 100% sure how it'll turn out, it's bound to be a fun adventure and hopefully we can create something amazing together.
